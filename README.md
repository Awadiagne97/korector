# Korector

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
If the server fails to start, specifically with the following messages :

`ng update` 
`npm update`

After finishing all commands above, re-run the `ng serve` to start your dev server.
